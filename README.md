Medical App

<b> Problem Statement: </b>

Over a great period, many issues have been faced by Medical Students who keep a survey of the hospital wards as their curriculum. 
One of the challenges they face every day is that they have to jot down the things and then compile the data of various wards manually. 
This creates a lot of confusion and also takes much time.
Technology plays a vital role in day-to-day life activities which in turn made great changes in many work fields and out of them Mobile Application is one of the major developments. Mobile Application can be used effectively for this job as they are widely used and are known for easy access.
